A script to create/delete apache virtualhosts in ~/public_html

Right now this script doesn't include a usage section, so here is how you use it.

This script requires sudo priv.

# This will create ~/public_html/test.local structure as 775 to $USER:www-data
# and create /etc/apache2/sites-available/test.local with http and https hosts.
# Then the site will be enabled and the webserver rebooted.
./vhost.sh add test

# THis will delete the apache config file and 
# disable the site and restart the webserver.
./vhost.sh del test

# Future feature, will fix permissions 
./vhost perm test
